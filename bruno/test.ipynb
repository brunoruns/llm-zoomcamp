      "The highest building in France is the Eiffel Tower, located in Paris. It stands at approximately 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, including its antenna. However, if you're referring to the highest habitable building or skyscraper, that would be the Tour First, also known as Tour CB31, located in the La DÃ©fense business district near Paris. It is about 231 meters (758 feet) tall and has 51 floors. The Eiffel Tower is not considered a building in the traditional sense, as it is a tower and not a habitable structure.\n"
